config:
  target: "https://www.bitheap.tech"
  engines:
    playwright: {}
  processor: "./tests/flow.js"

#This config section defines the general configuration of the test.
#target → Defines the base URL of the website to be tested (https://www.bitheap.tech).
#engines → Specifies that Artillery will use Playwright to execute tests.
#processor → Points to an external JavaScript file (./tests/flow.js) that contains the Playwright test function.

scenarios:
  - engine: playwright
    testFunction: "shopFlow"

#This scenarios section defines the test scenario(s) that Artillery will execute.
#engine: playwright → Specifies that the test will run using Playwright.
#testFunction: "shopFlow" → Calls the shopFlow function from flow.js, which contains the test logic.
# This means that during execution, Artillery will trigger the Playwright function shopFlow() (defined in flow.js) on multiple virtual users.

phases:

  - duration: 300
    arrivalRate: 50
    name: Sustained Peak load


#This phases section defines how the test load is applied over time.

#Each phase describes:
#duration → How long the phase runs (in seconds).
#arrivalRate → How many virtual users (VUs) start per second.
#rampTo → The peak number of virtual users per second.

#How the load test runs:
#Warm-up phase (60s)
#Starts with 5 users/sec, gradually increasing to 10 users/sec.
#Ramp-up phase (60s)
#Starts with 10 users/sec, gradually increasing to 50 users/sec.
#Sustained peak load (300s = 5 min)
#Runs 50 users/sec consistently for 5 minutes.
